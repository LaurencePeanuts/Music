A speculative project to map the entire universe over time with low spatial resolution using CMB, 21 cm and local surveys. The simple time-evolution of the perturbations in the gravitational potential makes this a natural quantity to map; it (and its gradient) should be well constrained in a thin shell at z=1000 by the all-sky CMB data, and also by large scale structure surveys at low redshift. The longest wavelength fourier modes of the 3D potential will be best constrained; a question we are interested in is how high the resolution of a truly global evolving map of the universe can be made.

Applications of such a global map could include: predicting very large scale structures present in the reionization era, visible with 21cm surveys; cleaning the CMB and low redshift survey data by insisting on physical consistency; exploring the universe pre-recombination; improved tests of non-Gaussianity; we might anticipate many more.

3D maps constrained by CMB data have been investigated by Wandelt et al, at the epoch of last scattering. We are interested in pushing this idea to its limits, to make a map that is either constrained by, or (equivalently) capable of predicting, all the cosmological data we have and to understand what are the ultimate limits with future data.
